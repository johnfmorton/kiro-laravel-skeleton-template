# Kiro + Laravel Skeleton Template

Welcome to the Kiro + Laravel Skeleton Template. 

## Introduction

This repository is a fully-formed Laravel starter built from the experience of creating a real-world application with Kiro. Kiro provides a strong foundation for beginning a Laravel project, but it doesn’t include the steering documents or build-system structure that teams rely on when spinning up a production-ready workspace. This template fills that gap.

You get a complete development environment powered by DDEV, a working Vite setup with hot-module reloading, and a set of guiding documents that help shape conventions, workflows, and team collaboration from day one. Using this template saves at least an hour of initial setup time compared to assembling all of these pieces manually. It provides a consistent, fast, and opinionated starting point so you can focus on building features instead of wiring the project together.


## Features

* Laravel Ready: Comes pre-configured with a complete Laravel setup tailored for local development using DDEV.
* Vite Integration: Includes a Vite build process with hot module reloading, making front-end development smooth and efficient.
* Kiro Specs: Comes with highly tuned Kiro spec documents to ensure your code is human-readable and well-structured from the start.
* Makefile Included: Start your project simply by running make dev for an easy, no-fuss development experience.
